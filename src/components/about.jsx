              <p>Meta music is a self-organized music community for general listeners and music creators. Despite the basic functions of playing and searching music, listeners can comment on their favorite songs or create personalized song lists, and follow music creators that interest them. To enhance listener engagement, when registering for an account, users can join music subcommunities by selecting the genre of music they are interested in, and communicate with each other or share their music within the community.</p>
